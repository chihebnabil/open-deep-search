- **Self-Reporting Bias**: Reliance on self-reported data can introduce bias, affecting the accuracy of findings.
- **Generalization of Skills**: Students may struggle to apply learned skills in real-life situations, highlighting the need for ongoing practice and support.

## Next Steps or Areas for Further Investigation
- **Longitudinal Studies**: Conducting long-term studies to assess the effectiveness of emotional regulation interventions on procrastination over time.
- **Diverse Populations**: Exploring the impact of cultural and societal factors on procrastination behaviors across different demographics.
- **Technology Integration**: Investigating the effectiveness of online platforms and apps designed to teach and reinforce emotional regulation skills.

## Conclusion
The interplay between procrastination and emotional regulation is complex and multifaceted.
